# PHP-Exercise
A simple PHP exercise that I solved.

### Word Problem
```
For our activity # 2 Assume that we are creating a HRD (Human Resources Department) Applicant 
Verification system. Create a PHP program thataccepts resume/CV uploaded by the user/applicant.

Requirements:

1.) Every applicant that uploads their file should have a applicant number provided by your system
2.) Applicants can only upload a PDF file with a 10mb max size
3.) No applicant should upload their PDF more  than once
4.) Your system should accept the applicant's basic contact information (Name, address, contact number) and save it to a txt file
5.) The txt file name should be: surnameofapplicant_applicantnumber.txt
6.) Error trapping is a must
7.) Lastly, in your admin page. Admin should just enter the file name (file extension not included) of the accepted applicants and when the admin click the 'Accepted' button there should be a 'Passed' word appended at the start of the applicants txt file. And there should be a 'Failed' button that also appends 'Failed' if the applicant didn't met the expectation of our admin.
```
